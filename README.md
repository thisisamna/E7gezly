# E7gezly
Medical booking system that allows users to book appointments with doctors registered in the system, and doctors to view and organize their appointments.
# Project details
This was done for our first year assignment in univesrity. Funnily enough, as we were about to present it, I made some last-minute changes to the code that broke a lot of things in it, and we subsequently lost a couple points because of it. Still though, me and my teammate are improving it little by little and watering it like our little plant :)
